                        Other features of this framework mostly refer to the association or relationship it has with static files which are Javascript functions (or plugins) 
                        and Css utility classes. While spoova has its own internal library, some already known external libraries are favored for development. Spoova may work 
                        without these libraries, however, they have been integrated with the framework itself and thier absence may cause issues within the framework.

                        Spoova comes with its own list of simple css utility classes to handle designs such as flex boxes, fluid boxes, grids items, 
                        form classes, borders, paddings, margins, colors and backgrounds and so on. These utility classes are provided as first 
                        hand help to make development faster. Devlopers can learn about more on these utility classes from <a href="@route('::css')" class="hyperlink">here</a>.
                         
                    </div> <br>

                        Spoova does not have a javascript library of its own. However, it comes with helper functions which may prove useful in development. Although 
                        no internal library exists, spoova favors <code>Jquery</code> over other libraries and some of the helper functions and plugins depend on it.
                        While some of these are discussed under integerations below, you can learn more from <a href="@route('::javascript')" class="hyperlink">here</a>. <br>
                        <!-- Javascript functions to Javascript plugins, some of which are jquery dependent. Some of the plugins 
                        that comes with this framework are listed below: <br> -->

                        Integerated functions are activities that are built into the framework which may have their dependencies on external libraries, javascript functions or even css utility classes. 
                        In some cases, a response could depend on all of these dependencies altogether. These integerations sometimes use html attributes to effect their functions. In order to allow 
                        these integerations to work effectively, all core resource header files should be imported. This is done with <code>@(Res(':headers'))@</code> rex template directive. <br><br>
                        
                        <div class="integerated-images">
                            <div class="font-em-d95 c-orange-dd">Integerated: Lazy-Loading Images</div>                        
                            As an added feature, spoova manages lazy-loading of images through javascript along with a specifically 
                            reserved html attribute <code>data-src</code>. If the <code>data-src</code> attribute is added to any html element, then lazy-loading is applied to that element. The 
                            <code>data-src</code> can be applied in this way:
    <div class="pre-area shadow shadow-1-strong mvs-4">
        <pre class="pre-code">
  &lt;img data-src="http://site.com/some-image.jpg" &gt;
  
  &lt;div data-src="http://site.com/some-image.jpg" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    In the above, both the <code>img</code> and <code>div</code> class will be resolved differently into the code below respectively.
    <div class="pre-area shadow shadow-1-strong mvs-4">
        <pre class="pre-code">
  &lt;img src="http://site.com/some-image.jpg" data-src="http://site.com/some-image.jpg" &gt;

  &lt;div style="background-image:url('http://site.com/some-image.jpg')" data-src="http://site.com/some-image.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    From the code above, we can conclude that <code>div</code> elements are assigned a <code>backround-image</code> css property while
    <code>img</code> elements are assigned the <code>src</code> attribute. If we are working within our template files, we can also apply the 
    <code>@(domurl())@</code> directive to assign a url value to the <code>href</code> attribute.
                        </div><br>
                        
                        <div class="integerated-page-scrolling">

                            <div class="">
                                <div class="font-em-d95 c-orange-dd">Integerated: Smooth Page Scrolling</div>                        
                                A special feature for managing page scroll is the <code>data-scroll</code> and <code>data-scroll-hash</code> attributes. 
                                These attributes helps to scroll to an element having an id attribute value that matches the supplied value of these attributes. 
                                Since the <code>data-scroll-hash</code> attibute performs both the function of <code>data-scroll</code> and even more extended features, 
                                this attribute alone will be discussed. The only major difference between these two attributes is that <code>data-scroll-hash</code> 
                                works for the current page hash as an extended feature. Other relative attributes that can be applied on these attributes are <code>data-plus</code> 
                                , <code>data-minus</code> which are used for adding or subtracting from target scroll point. There is also the <code>data-delay</code> which set a timeout 
                                before the scroll is executed.
                            </div>

    In the above, using the test url as current page url. If the button is clicked, the url hash string <code class="c-white">"someid"</code> 
    will be obtained. Once this is done, then the page will

  In the above, once the link is clicked, the page url hashstring will change to <code class="c-white">newhash</code>. Once this is done, the new hash

    <div class="pxv-10 bc-sea-blue c-white">
    In the above, if the current page url is the test url above, if a user scrolls off from the div element and reloads the page, the <code class="c-white">hashRunner()</code> 
    function will re-scroll back to that div element. This might be useful to help a user return back to the target element once the page is reloaded.
